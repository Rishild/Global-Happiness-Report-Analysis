Conclusion

The Global Happiness Report analysis highlights the significant role of economic, social, and governance factors in shaping the well-being of nations. By comparing countries and regions over time, the project demonstrates that happiness is not determined by a single metric, but by a balanced combination of GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and trust in institutions.

The interactive dashboards provide a clear and engaging way to explore these patterns, enabling policymakers, researchers, and the public to better understand the drivers of happiness. Ultimately, the project emphasizes that sustainable progress requires improving both economic prosperity and social well-being.
